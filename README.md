# ðŸš€  Labfriend Database Performance Test
# ðŸŽ¯ Database Query Performance Testing

- This JMeter project was  designed to identify performance issues, slowness, and query optimisation opportunities within the applicationâ€™s database layer.

- After discussions with the team, we identified key scenarios involving complex queries.

- Configured JDBC Connection Configuration in JMeter to connect directly with the database.

- Created JDBC Requests for each scenario to simulate real query executions.

 # ðŸ”­During testing, we identified:

- Areas where queries required optimization.

- Thread pool limits of the database connections.
